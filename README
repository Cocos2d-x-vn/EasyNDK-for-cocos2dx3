This is an update to the EasyNDK project created by Amir Ali Jiwani.
Cocos2d-x v3.0 introduced new classes such as cocos2d::Value and
containers such as cocos2d::Map<> and cocos2d::Vector<>. However, v3.0
also deprecated most of the classes that the original EasyNDK source
relied upon. This repo updates EasyNDK to work with these changes.

If you're curious about how the system works, please see the original
project page.

The sample Cocos2d-x project included in this repo will illustrate how
to set up the directories and get communication between your game and
the native Java/Obj-C environment up and running quickly. The included
jansson library has been modified to successfully build with Android.

The project was created with the Cocos2d-x v3.0 RC0 console. If you
clone this repo and want to build and run the sample project, you
will have to manually copy the "cocos2d" directory that usually gets
copied while running the cocos project creator into the
"EasyNDKSample" project.
